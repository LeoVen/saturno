# Decisions Log

Every entry here records a point where implementation either **deviated**
from `specs/`, **clarified** something the spec left genuinely open, or made
a standalone **implementation-only** call not covered by the spec at all
(e.g. a library choice, a folder layout). See `PROCESS.md` §5.

`specs/` is never edited to match these — this log, read together with
`specs/`, is the current source of truth. Newest entries at the top.

Template for a new entry:

```
## D-<NN> — <short title>

- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Type**: Deviation | Clarification | Implementation-only
- **Spec refs**: FR-#, TR-#, or IMPL.md §# (omit if Implementation-only and genuinely nothing to reference)
- **What changes**: one or two sentences — what actually happens now, vs. what the spec said/left open.
- **Why**: the concrete reason (test result, user call, practical constraint).
- **Affected epics/tasks**: E##-... (so the epic file can point back here)
```
